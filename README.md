Domain: growinseason.com

APIs being used: Yumly (recipes)

Farmers posting their harvests so their customers can see what they're in for and see readily available recipes

In other words:

I belong to a CSA - a Community Supported/Shared Agriculture - Basically, I get a hell of a lot of vegetables every week but I have no idea what's coming, often forget what they are when I get them home, and usually have no idea how to make them or what to use them in. A lot of people I know share this sentiment, so I imagine there are plenty of CSA or Farm Stand or Farmer Market customers with rotting vegetables in their crisper.

GROWINSEASON requests that the manager or farmer heading a CSA, farmers' market, or farm stand - sign up and update a page that lists the harvest available to customers.

A typical customer would be able to journey to the site, search for the name of their desired CSA/market/farm and see a list of food available, upon rollover of an ingredient, the Yumly api is pinged and a list of possible recipes is displayed.
